Abstract
Automated behavior analysis are promising tools to overcome current assessment limitations in psychiatry.
At
9 months of age, we recorded 32 infants with West syndrome (WS) and 19 typically developing (TD) controls during a
standardized mother–infant interaction.
We computed infant hand movements (HM), speech turn taking of both
partners (vocalization, pause, silences, overlap) and motherese.
Then, we assessed whether multimodal social signals
and interactional synchrony at 9 months could predict outcomes (autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual
disability (ID)) of infants with WS at 4 years.
At follow-up, 10 infants developed ASD/ID (WS+).
The best machine
learning reached 76.47% accuracy classifying WS vs. TD and 81.25% accuracy classifying WS+ vs. WS−.
The 10 best
features to distinguish WS+ and WS−included a combination of infant vocalizations and HM features combined with
synchrony vocalization features.
These data indicate that behavioral and interaction imaging was able to predict ASD/
ID in high-risk children with WS.
Introduction
Behavior and interaction imaging is a promising domain
of affective computing to explore psychiatric conditions1–3.
Regarding
child
psychiatry,
many
researchers
have
attempted to identify reliable indicators of neurodevelop-
mental disorders (NDD) in high-risk populations (e.g., sib-
lings of children with autism) during the ﬁrst year of life to
recommend early interventions4,5.
However, social signals
and any alterations of them are very difﬁcult to identify at
such a young age6.
In addition, exploring the quality and
dynamics of early interactions is a complex endeavor.
It
usually requires (i) the perception and integration of mul-
timodal social signals and (ii) an understanding of how two
interactive partners synchronize and proceed in turn
taking7,8.
Affective computing offers the possibility to simulta-
neously analyze the interaction of several partners while
considering the multimodal nature and dynamics of social
signals and behaviors9.
To date, few seminal studies have
attempted
to
apply
social
signal
processing
to
mother–infant interactions with or without a speciﬁc
condition, and these studies have focused on speech turns
(e.g., Jaffe et al.10), motherese11, head movements12, hand
movements13,
movement
kinematics2,
and
facial
expressions3.
Here, we focused on West syndrome (WS), a rare epi-
leptic encephalopathy with early onset (before age 1 year)
and a high risk of NDD outcomes, including one-third of
WS children showing later autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) and/or intellectual disability (ID).
We recruited 32
infants with WS and 19 typically developing (TD) controls
to participate in a standardized early mother–infant

assess outcomes at 4 years of age.
We aim to explore
whether multimodal social signals and interpersonal
synchrony of infant–mother interactions at 9 months
could predict outcomes.
Materials and methods
Design, participants, and clinical measures
We performed a prospective follow-up study of infants
with WS14.
The Institutional Review Board (Comité de
Protection des Personnes from the Groupe-Hospitalier
Necker Enfants Malades) approved the study, and both
parents gave written informed consent after they received
verbal and written information on the study.
They were
asked to participate to a follow-up study to assess out-
come of WS taking into account development, early
interaction, genetics and response to pharmacological
treatment14.
The study was conducted from November
2004 to March 2010 in the Neuro-pediatrics Department
Center for Rare Epilepsia of Necker Enfants-Malades
Hospital, Paris.
Of the 41 patients screened during the
study period, we enrolled all but two cases (N = 39) with
WS.
Seven patients dropped out before the age of 3
leading to a sample of 32 patients with detailed follow-up
data.
Typical developing infants (N = 19) were recruited
from Maternal and Infant Prevention institutions, in
pediatric consultations, or by proxy.
To assess neurodevelopmental outcomes, we focused on
ID and ASD.
ID was assessed through the Brunet-Lézine
Developmental Examination, performed for all children at
the age of 3 years.
The Brunet-Lézine Developmental
Examination estimates a developmental quotient (DQ)
based upon normative data available for 3-year-old
French toddlers15.
The diagnosis of autism was based
upon several measurements and an expert assessment
that was blind to other variables: (i) At 3 years of age, all
parents completed the Autism Diagnostic Interview-
Revised (ADI-R) to assess autism signs by dimensions
and developmental delay16.
(ii) At 2 and 3 years of age, all
patients were assessed with the Children’s Autism Rating
Scale (CARS)17.
(iii) An expert clinician (LR) who was
blind to child history assessed autism and ID from 20-min
videotapes of child/mother play at 2 years of age.
Finally,
diagnoses of ASD and/or ID at age 4 were based upon a
consensus approach using direct assessment of the child
by a clinician with expertise in autism (LO) as well as by
clinical information from the CARS, ADI-R, and DQ.
Video recordings
Infant–mother interactions were assessed between 9
and 12 months of age during a play session (Fig.
1).
Two
synchronized cameras (face and proﬁle; Fig.
S1A) recor-
ded the movements in two dimensions while the infant
was sitting in a baby chair.

recorded.
The standardized situation encompassed three
sequences of 3 min: (sequence 1) free play after instruct-
ing the mother to interact “as usual” without any toy;
(sequence 2) free play using the help of a toy (Sophie the
giraffe); (sequence 3) mother singing to her baby.
Due to
the position of the baby chair on the ﬂoor and the
mother’s seated position, the mother was positioned
slightly higher in all of the recordings.
The mother’s
indicated position was on the left of the child as shown on
the picture, but exceptions were sometimes observed
during the recordings.
For infant hand movement (HM)
features, 1 min was extracted from each 3-min video and
all recordings, according to two criteria: the child’s hands
should be visible for at least part of the sequence (e.g., the
mother is not leaning on the child), and the minute
represented the greatest amount of interaction between
the mother and the child.
For audio and speech turn-
taking
computing,
we
only
used
the
3-min
audio
recording of sequence 1.
Vision computing (Fig.
S1B, vision computing panel)
To process infant hand movements (HM), we used the
methods developed in Ouss et al.13.
Here, we summarize
the successive steps to calculate HM features.
In step 1
(hand trajectory extraction and data processing), the two-
dimensional coordinates of the hand were extracted from
each of the video recordings by tracking a wristband on
the right hand (yellow in Fig.
S1A, video-audio recording
panel).
The tracking framework comprised three steps:
prediction, observation, and estimation as proposed in
ref.
18.
As the hand motion was highly nonlinear, we
developed an approach using a bootstrap-based particle
ﬁlter with a ﬁrst-order model to address abrupt changes in
direction and speed19,20.
To address hand occlusion, we
implemented
an
approach
combining
tracking
with
detection by adding a boolean variable to the state vector
associated with each particle18.
Each extracted trajectory consisted of 1500 pairs of x
and y coordinates (25 frames per second, generating 1500
pairs of coordinates in the 60 s; see Fig.
S1 left panel,
vision computing).
The frames where the hand was not
visible were clearly indicated in each trajectory as missing
coordinates for these time points.
To account for differ-
ences in the camera zoom parameters, the trajectories
obtained were normalized using a ﬁxed reference system
present in the settings of each video recording.
The nor-
malization was performed on all trajectories, and 95% of
the normalization factors ranged between 0.8 and 1.22
with a few outlier trajectories that required greater cor-
rection.
Forty-one percent of the trajectories required <5%
correction.
Although the recordings between the two
cameras were synchronized and in principle allowed 3D
reconstruction of the trajectory, the accumulation of
missing data prevented such reconstruction.
However, 2D
motion capture with appropriately deﬁned movement
descriptors can be powerful for detecting clinically rele-
vant changes21, thereby justifying the independent ana-
lysis of the 2D-trajectory videos (see Fig.
S1B, vision
computing, 2d panel on the left).
In step 2, the descriptors of the HM were calculated
from the planar trajectories (Fig.
S1B, table shown in the
vision
computing
panel).
Descriptors
covered
those
already reported in the literature as important in char-
acterizing infants’ HM21.
(1) To describe the space
explored by the hand, we calculated the maximum dis-
tance observed on the two axes (xRange, yRange) and the
standard deviation of the X and Y coordinates observed
during the 60 s (xSd, ySd).
We also calculated the max-
imum distance between any two points of the trajectory
using
the
FarthestPair
java
library
(http://algs4.cs.
princeton.edu/code/) (Fig.
S1B, vision computing panel,
red line in the third panel from the left).
(2) To evaluate
HM dynamics, we calculated the velocity and accelera-
tion.
(3) Also related to HM dynamics, we calculated HM
pauses deﬁned as part of the trajectory in which the
velocity was lower than a speciﬁc threshold for a mini-
mum duration of 4 s. (4) Finally, the curvature of the
trajectories was calculated using a standard deﬁnition of
the curvature (κ) of plane curves in Cartesian coordinates
as γ(t) = (x(t), y(t)).
The curvature calculated at each point
of the trajectory is presented in the right panel of Fig.
S1B
(video computing), where the ﬁrst 1.2 s of the trajectory
are plotted and the associated calculated curvatures at
each point (and respective time, indicated on the axis) are
presented as columns.
Audio computing (Fig.
S1C, audio computing)
We extracted two types of audio social signals from the
audio channel of the mother–infant interaction: speech
turn taking (STT) and motherese.
For STT extraction, we
followed the methods developed by Weisman et al.22 and
Bourvis et al.23 (Fig.
S1, audio computing).
First, we used
ELAN to segment the infants’ and mothers’ speech turns
and annotate the dialog acts.
Mothers’ audio interactions
were categorized as mother vocalization (meaningful
vocalizations, laugh, singing, animal sounds) or other
noise (clap hands, snap ﬁngers or snap the tongue, mouth
noise, etc.).
Similarly, infants’ audio production was
deﬁned as infant vocalization (babbling vocalizations,
laugh, and cry) or atypical vocalization (other noise such
as “rale”).
The infant’s and mother’s utterances were
labeled by two annotators (blind to group status).
Cohen’s
kappa between the two annotators was calculated for each
dyad, each task and each item of the grid.
For all items, the
kappa values were between 0.82 and 1.
From the annotation, we extracted all the speech turns
of the infant and the mother.
A speech turn is a con-
tinuous stream of speech with <150 ms of silence.
We
Ouss et al.
Translational Psychiatry  (2020) 10:54 
Page 3 of 7
obtained a list of triples: speaker label (infant or mother),
start time, and duration of speech turn.
From these triples,
we also deduced the start time and duration of the time
segments when the mother or the infant were not
speaking
(pauses).
Therefore,
we
extracted
Mother
Vocalizations; Mother Other Noise; Infant Vocalizations;
Infant Atypical Vocalizations; Mother Pauses; Infant
Pauses.
We also extracted three dyadic features: (1)
Silence deﬁned as sequences of time during which neither
participant was speaking for more than 150 ms; (2)
Overlap Ratio deﬁned as the duration of vocalization
overlaps between mothers and infants divided by the
duration of the total interaction.
This ratio measures the
proportion of interactional time in which both partici-
pants were simultaneously vocalizing; (3) Infant Syn-
chrony Ratio deﬁned as the number of infants’ responses
to their mother’s vocalization within a time limit of 3 s
divided by the number of mother vocalizations during the
time paradigm.
The 3-s window was based on the avail-
able literature on synchrony7,24.
From the mother vocalizations, we also computed
affective speech analysis, as previous work has shown that
motherese may shape parent-infant interactions25.
The
segments of mother vocalizations were analyzed using a
computerized classiﬁer for categorization as “motherese”
or “non-motherese/other speech” initially developed to
analyze home movies11.
The system exploits the fusion of
two classiﬁers, namely, segmental and suprasegmental26.
Consequently, the utterances are characterized by both
segmental (Mel frequency cepstrum coefﬁcients) and
suprasegmental/prosodics (e.g., statistics with regard to
fundamental frequency, energy, and duration) features.
The detector used the GMM (Gaussian mixture model)
classiﬁer for both segmental and suprasegmental features
(M, number of Gaussians for the GMM Classiﬁer: M = 12
and 15, respectively, and λ = weighting coefﬁcient used in
the equation fusion: λ = 0.4).
For the purpose of the
current study, we explored the performance of our
motherese classiﬁer in French mothers.
We analyzed
200 sequences from French mothers (100 motherese vs.
100 other speech) that were blindly validated by two
psycholinguists.
We calculated the Intraclass correlation
(ICC) between the two raters (the expert and the algo-
rithm) and found a good and very signiﬁcant ICC (ICC =
0.79 (95% CI: 0.59–0.90), p < 0.001).
This level of predic-
tion made it suitable for further analysis of the entire
data set.
Based on this automatic detection of motherese, we
created two subclasses for mother vocalizations: mother-
ese vs. non-motherese.
Two variables were derived:
Motherese Ratio (duration of motherese vocalization/
duration of interaction) and Non-motherese Ratio (dura-
tion of non-motherese vocalization/duration of interac-
tion).
We also derived two synchrony ratios: Synchrony
Motherese Ratio and Synchrony Non-motherese Ratio,
which reﬂect the ratio of time during which the infant
vocalizes in response to his/her mother motherese and
other speech (non-motherese).
Prediction of the outcome using machine learning
The pipeline of our approach is shown in Fig.
1.
First, a
data quality analysis was performed to ensure the validity
of the data.
As expected, all data were available for audio
analysis.
However, a substantial proportion of the data
were discarded due to video recording or vision com-
puting issues.
We ﬁnally kept 18 video recordings for the
WS and 17 videos for the TD groups.
Second, given the
number of features (21 infant HM for each camera and
each sequence; 16 STT) compared with the data set (32
WS and 19 TD), we reduced our data using principal
component analysis (PCA).
Third, we tested several
algorithms to classify WS vs. TD based on the whole data
set available for both vision and audio computing features
(leave one out) (Table S1).
The best algorithm was deci-
sion stump27.
All results presented here are based on the
classiﬁcation with a decision stump algorithm.
We also
analyzed WS with ID/ASD (WS+) vs. WS without ID/
ASD (WS−).
For each classiﬁcation, we also extracted a
confusion matrix and explored which individual features
contributed the most to a given classiﬁcation using
Pearson correlations.
Results
Table S2 summarizes the demographic and clinical
characteristics of children with WS.
At follow-up, 10
infants out of 32 children with WS developed ASD/ID
(WS+).
Eight children had ASD and ID, whereas 2 had
only ID.
As expected, all variables related to ASD and ID
were signiﬁcantly different in WS+ compared with WS−.
Figure 2a summarizes the best classiﬁcation models
using the decision stump algorithm (leave one out).
As
shown, multimodal classiﬁcation outperformed unimodal
classiﬁcation to distinguish WS and TD.
Therefore, we
only used the multimodal approach to classify WS+ vs.
WS−.
The best model reached 76.47% accuracy classify-
ing WS vs. TD and 81.25% accuracy classifying WS+ vs.
WS−based on multimodal features extracted during early
interactions.
Interestingly, the confusion matrices (Fig.
2b) show that when classifying WS vs. TD, all errors came
from TD being misclassiﬁed as WS (N = 12); when clas-
sifying WS+ vs. WS−, most errors came from WS+ being
misclassiﬁed as WS−(N = 5).
Table 1 lists the best features for each multimodal
classiﬁcation based on the Pearson correlation values.
The
best features to distinguish WS and TD included four
infant HM features, 1 mother audio feature.
In contrast,
the best features to distinguish WS+ and WS−included a
combination
of

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to
apply
multimodal
social
signal
processing
to
mother–infant interactions in the context of WS.
Com-
bining
speech
turns
and
infant
HM
during
an
infant–mother interaction at 9 months signiﬁcantly pre-
dicted the development of ASD or severe to moderate ID
at 4 years of age in the high-risk children with WS.
Confusion matrices showed that the classiﬁcation errors
were not random, enhancing the interest of the compu-
tational method proposed here.
In addition, the best
contributing features for the performed classiﬁcations
differed when classifying WS vs. TD and WS+ vs. WS−.
Infant HMs were the most signiﬁcant features to distin-
guish WS versus TD, probably reﬂecting the motor
impact due to acute WS encephalopathy.
For classifying
WS+ vs. WS−, the contribution of infant audio features
and synchrony features became much more relevant
combined with several HM features.
We believe that the importance of synchrony and
reciprocity during early interactions is in line with
recent studies that have investigated the risk of ASD or
NDD during the ﬁrst year of life from home movies
(e.g., refs.
11,24), from prospective follow-up of high-risk
infants such as siblings (e.g., refs.
4,28) or infants with
WS (e.g., ref.
14), and from prospective studies assessing
tools to screen risk for autism (e.g., ref.
29).
In the ﬁeld of
ASD, synchrony, reciprocity, parental sensitivity, and
emotional engagement are now proposed as targets of
early interventions30, which could prevent early inter-
active vicious circles.
Parents of at-risk infants try to
compensate for the lack of interactivity of their child by
modifying their stimulation and therefore sometimes
reinforcing
the
dysfunctional
interactions24.
Early
identiﬁcation of these interactive targets is especially
useful among babies with neurological comorbidities
because
delays
in
developmental
milestones
and
impairments in early social interactions are not sufﬁ-
cient to predict ASD.
Similarly, we believe that the importance of HM in
distinguishing WS vs. TD on one hand, and WS+ vs.
WS−on the other hand, is also in line with the studies
that investigated the importance of non-social behaviors
for investigating the risk of ASD or NDD during the ﬁrst
year of life.
For example, studying home movies, Purpura
et al.
found more bilateral HM and ﬁnger movements in
infants who will later develop ASD31.
Similarly, several
prospective follow-up studies of high-risk siblings32–35 or
retrospective studies on home movies36,37 reported spe-
ciﬁc motor atypical repertoire in infants with ASD.
In ASD, early social signals have previously been
assessed with automatized and computational procedures,
focusing on eye tracking at early stages38–40, vocal pro-
ductions41, analysis of acoustics of ﬁrst utterances or cry
episodes42, but none was done in an interactive setting.
Our study proposed a paradigm shift from the assessment
of infant behavior to dyadic assessment of interactions, as
previously achieved in retrospective approaches using
home movies24.
The aim is not to implement studies of
social signal processing in routine clinical work but rather
to decompose clinical intuitions and signs and validate the
most relevant cues of these clinical features.
From clinical
work, back to clinics, social signal processing is a rigorous
step to help clinicians better identify and assess early
targets of interventions.
Given the exploratory nature of both our approach and
method, our results should be interpreted with caution
taking into account strengths (prospective follow-up,
automatized multimodal social signal processing, and
ecological
standardized
assessment)
and
limitations.
These limitations include (1) the overall sample size
knowing that WS is a rare disease; (2) the high rate of
missing data during video recording due to the ecological
conditions of the infant–mother interaction (mothers
interposing between the camera and the infant); the ﬁnal
sample size of WS+ (N = 10) that limited the power of
machine learning methods.
We conclude that the method proposed here combining
multimodal automatized assessment of social signal pro-
cessing during early interaction with infants at risk for
NDD is a promising tool to decipher clinical features that
remain difﬁcult to identify and assess.
In the context of
WS, we showed that such a method we proposed to label
‘behavioral and interaction imaging’ was able to sig-
niﬁcantly predict the development of ASD or ID at 4 years
of age in high-risk children who had WS and were
assessed at 9 months of age.
