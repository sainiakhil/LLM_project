Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder with a life-span disability.
While diagnostic instruments have been developed and qualiﬁed based on the accuracy of the
discrimination of children with ASD from typical development (TD) children, the stability of such
procedures can be disrupted by limitations pertaining to time expenses and the subjectivity of
clinicians.
Consequently, automated diagnostic methods have been developed for acquiring objective
measures of autism, and in various ﬁelds of research, vocal characteristics have not only been reported
as distinctive characteristics by clinicians, but have also shown promising performance in several
studies utilizing deep learning models based on the automated discrimination of children with
ASD from children with TD.
However, diﬃculties still exist in terms of the characteristics of the
data, the complexity of the analysis, and the lack of arranged data caused by the low accessibility
for diagnosis and the need to secure anonymity.
In order to address these issues, we introduce
a pre-trained feature extraction auto-encoder model and a joint optimization scheme, which can
achieve robustness for widely distributed and unreﬁned data using a deep-learning-based method
for the detection of autism that utilizes various models.
By adopting this auto-encoder-based
feature extraction and joint optimization in the extended version of the Geneva minimalistic acoustic
parameter set (eGeMAPS) speech feature data set, we acquire improved performance in the detection
of ASD in infants compared to the raw data set.

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder with a high probability of causing
diﬃculties in social interactions with other people .
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), ASD involves several characteristics such as being
conﬁned to speciﬁc interests or behaviors, delayed linguistic development, and poor functionality in
terms of communicating or functioning in social situations .
As there is wide variation in terms of
the types and severities of ASD based on its characteristics, the disorder is referred to as a spectrum .
Not only does ASD have the characteristics of a developmental disorder with a life-span disability, but
its prevalence is also increasing—from 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 54 children in 2016 .
As diverse
evidence has been obtained from previous research showing that the chance of improvement in the

social abilities of people with ASD increases when an earlier clinical intervention is performed , the
early detection of ASD characteristics has become a key point of current ASD research.
Various instruments for discriminating ASD have been developed, and the commonly accepted
gold standard schemes are behavioral assessments, which are time-consuming procedures and require
multidisciplinary teams (MDTs).
However, most behavioral assessments suﬀer in terms of the stability
of their ASD diagnosis as a result of the issues of accessibility or subjectivity and interpretive bias
between professions .
Therefore, several attempts to develop objective and precise diagnostic
methods have been made in multiple ﬁelds, such as genetic determination , principle analysis of
brain images , and physiological approaches .
One prominent area of behavioral observations is that of infants’ vocal characteristics.
Children
with ASD are known to have abnormalities in their prosody resulting from deﬁcits in their ability to
recognize the inherent mental conditions of others , and their atypical vocalizations are known to be
monotonous or exaggerated, which can be revealed using various acoustic characteristics, followed
by engineering approaches for the discrimination of ASD or typical development (TD) in children
based on the vocal and acoustic features.
For example, in , the researchers estimated deﬁcits in the
vocalization of children with ASD at an average age of 18 months, such as “ﬂat” intonation, atypical
pitch, or control of volume based on the variability of pitch and the long-term average spectrum
(LTAS) using fast Fourier transform, where signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in the spectral
components at low-band frequencies, as well as spectral peaks and larger pitch ranges and standard
deviations.
The development of linguistic abilities is also considered to be a distinguishable feature of
delayed development in children with ASD.
Earlier vocal patterns at age 6–18 months were proven
to be diﬀerentiable in a study  that aimed to conﬁrm the hypothetical vocal patterns and social
quality of vocal behavior in order to diﬀerentiate between ASD and TD cohorts in groups of children
aged 0–6, 6–12, and 12–18 months in terms of categorized speech patterns consisting of vocalization,
long reduplicated babbling, two-syllable babbling, and ﬁrst words.
Evidence of abnormalities in
children with ASD were shown, in these cases, as a signiﬁcant decrease in vocalization and ﬁrst word
rate, while the diﬀerence in babbling ability between children with ASD and TD was negligible.
Given the development and improvement of machine learning algorithms, as the achievement
in the performance of state-of-the-art classiﬁcation and discrimination tasks , recent attempts to
develop automated classiﬁcation methods based on machine learning techniques have been based
on the distinctiveness of vocal characteristics, and have been shown to be promising alternatives to
the conventional methods in many publications .
For examples of machine learning classiﬁcation,
the researchers of  employed various acoustic–prosodic features, including fundamental frequency,
formant frequencies, harmonics, and root mean square signal energy.
In their research, support vector
machines (SVMs) and probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) were adopted as classiﬁers, which showed
eﬀectual accuracy in discriminating children with ASD from children with TD.
Meanwhile, the authors
of  employed more recent deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with spectral features from short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
and constant Q transform (CQT), to classify children diagnosed using the autism diagnostic observation
schedule (ADOS), also showing promising results in multiple outcomes from SVMs, RNNs, and a
combination of CNN and RNN classiﬁers.
A generalized acoustic feature set, an extended version of the Geneva minimalistic acoustic
parameter set (eGeMAPS) , and the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) model were
adopted to diﬀerentiate between children with ASD and children with TD in , showing that 75% of
the subjects’ utterances were correctly classiﬁed with the simple application of a deep learning model
and feature sets.
While the quality of previous research based on various acoustic features has proven
the eﬀectiveness of acoustic features and classiﬁcation algorithms for the detection of abnormalities in
children’s voices in ASD group compared to those of TD group, the complexity and relationship being
inherent between the features will remain uncertain until a large amount of data can be accumulated.
Furthermore, a limitation still remains in terms of the problems regarding data collection, since there are
Sensors 2020, 20, 6762

diﬃculties pertaining to the need to secure the anonymity of infant subjects, as well as the unintended
ignorance of parents at earlier stages of their infant’s development.
The data of infants are, accordingly,
dispersed by gender, age, and number of vocalizations, or consist of comparably small volumes of
audio engineering data in general.
These problems were typically overlooked by previous research
with controlled and small amounts of data.
In order to provide suggestions for a method to overcome the abovementioned restrictions, we focus
on examining the feasibility of neural networks as a feature extractor, employing an auto-encoder (AE),
which can modify acoustic features into lowered and separable feature dimensions .
We construct a
simple six-layered stacked AE that contains an input layer, three fully connected (FC) layers, an output
layer, and one auxiliary output layer, which has categorical targets for ASD and TD for the optimization
of the latent feature space of the AE.
We train the AE and deep learning models and compare the
results for each model based on SVMs and vanilla BLSTM, while adopting the same model parameters
from the method suggested in .
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the speciﬁcations of the
participants’ data, data processing, feature extraction, statistical analysis, and experimental setup.
Section 3 presents the performance evaluations for each algorithm of the SVMs and vanilla BLSTM.
Lastly, Section 4 concludes the paper.

Proposed Method
2.1.
Data Collection and Acoustic Feature Extraction
This study was based on the audio data from video recordings of ASD diagnoses, which were
collected from 2016 to 2018 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH).
We received
approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at SNUBH to use fully anonymized data for
retrospective analysis (IRB no: B-1909/567-110) from existing research (IRB no: B-1607/353-005).
We collected the audio data of 39 infants who were assessed using seven multiple instruments,
consisting of (1) ADOS, second edition (ADOS-2), (2) the autism diagnostic interview, revised (ADI-R),
(3) the behavior development screening for toddlers interview (BeDevel-I), (4) the behavior development
screening for toddlers play (BeDevel-P), (5) the Korean version of the childhood autism rating scale
(K-CARS) reﬁned from CARS-2, (6) the social communication questionnaire (SCQ), and (7) the social
responsiveness scale (SRS) [19–22].
The ﬁnal diagnosis was based on the best clinical estimate diagnosis
according to the DSM-5 ASD criteria by a licensed child psychiatrist using all of the available participant
information.
The participants’ ages ranged between 6 and 24 months, where the average age was
19.20 months with a standard deviation (SD) of 2.52 months.
Note here that the age means the age
at the time when each infant visited the hospital to undergo an initial diagnosis examination.
There
were four males and six females diagnosed with ASD, whose average age was 14.72 months with a
SD of 2.45.
The remaining participants consisted of TD children (19 males and 10 females).

As each infant’s audio data were recorded during the clinical procedure to elicit behaviors from
infants, with the attendance of one doctor or clinician and one or both parents with the child in the
clinical area, the audio components consisted of various speeches from the child, the clinician, and the
parent(s), as well as noises from toys or dragging chairs.
Note here that the recordings were done in one
of two typical clinical rooms in SNUBH, where the room dimensions were 365 cm × 400 cm × 270 cm
and 350 cm × 350 cm × 270 cm, and the hospital noise level was around 40 dB.
In order to analyze
the vocal characteristics of the infants, each audio clip was processed and split into audio segments
containing the infant’s voice, not disturbed by music or clattering noises from toys or overlapped
by the voices of the clinician or parent(s).
Each segment was classiﬁed into one of ﬁve categories,
labeled from 0 to 4, for measuring the data distribution.
Each label was intended to show diﬀerentiable
characteristics relative to the children’s linguistic development: (1) 0 for one syllable, which is a short,
Sensors 2020, 20, 6762

momentary single vocalization such as “ah” or “ba”; (2) 1 for two syllables, commonly denoted as
canonical babbling, as a reduplication of clear babbling of two identical or variant syllables such as
“baba” or “baga”; (3) 2 for babbling, not containing syllables; (4) 3 for ﬁrst word, such as “mother” or
“father”; and (5) 4 for atypical voice, including screaming or crying.
The distribution of each type of
vocalization in seconds is shown in Table 3.
The number of vocalizations per category is presented
along with a rational value considering the diﬀerence between the ASD and TD groups.
While the
data were unbalanced and very small, the distribution of ASD and TD vocalizations show the same
tendency as reported in , where the ASD group showed a signiﬁcantly lower ratio of ﬁrst words
and an increased ratio of atypical vocalizations, revealing developmental delay in linguistic ability.

For acquiring qualiﬁed and eﬀective feature sets for the vocal data, eGeMAPS was employed
for voice feature extraction.
GeMAPS is a popular feature set providing minimalistic speech features
generally utilized for automatic voice analysis rather than as a large brute force parameter set.
As an
extended version, eGeMAPS contains 88 acoustic features that were fully utilized in this experiment.
Each recorded set of audio data stored as a 48 kHz stereo ﬁle was down-sampled and down-mixed into a
16 kHz mono-audio ﬁle, taking into consideration its usability and resolution in mel-frequency cepstral
coeﬃcients (MFCCs).
To extract the speech features for ASD classiﬁcation, each infant’s utterances
were segmented into 25 ms frames with a 10 ms overlap between frames.
Then, 88 diﬀerent features of
the eGeMAPS were extracted for each frame with open source speech and music interpretation using
the large-space extraction (OpenSMILE) toolkit , and these features were normalized by mean and
standard deviation.
The normalization scaling was acquired and ﬁxed by normalizing the factors of
the training data set.
The features were grouped for each ﬁve frames considering the time-relevant
characteristics of the speech data.
2.2.
Pre-Trained AE for Acoustic Features
To further process and reﬁne the acoustic data, a feature-extracting AE was introduced.
An AE is a
hierarchical structure that is trained as a regression model for reproducing the input parameters.
The AE
takes inputs and converts them into latent representations, and then reconstructs the input parameters
from the latent values .
If we consider an input of AE, x ∈Rd, then the latent representation z ∈Rd′
and the reconstruction of the input y ∈Rd are obtained by applying a nonlinear activation function
f to the weight sum of z using a weighting matrix W ∈Rd×d′ and a bias vector b ∈Rd′, such as
z = f

WTx + b

(1)
y = f

WTz + b′
(2)
where T is a matrix transpose operator.
When the latent dimension d′ < d, the output from the latent
layer is considered to be a compressed, meaningful value extracted from the input, which is also noted
as a bottleneck feature .
The normalized eGeMAPS features were applied to train the feature-extracting AE, applying
the same data as the input and the target.
The AE model contained a latent layer with a lowered,
compacted feature dimension compared to the input layer to achieve the useful bottleneck feature.

The model was symmetrically structured, centering around the latent layer, and the model could be
divided into two components: the encoder, consisting of layers from the input to the latent layers,
and a decoder, consisting of layers from the bottleneck to the output layers.
The AE structure is depicted in Figure 1.
Our AE model consisted of FC layers, with the dimensions
of 88, 70, 54, 70, and 88 nodes for the input, hidden, latent, hidden, and output layers, respectively.
The hidden dimension was selected experimentally and the bottleneck feature dimension was used for
comparison with previous research , where 54 features were selected considering the statistical
dissimilarity of the distributions between the ASD and TD features based on the Mann–Whitney U
test .
We additionally introduced an auxiliary output as the binary categorical target for ASD
and TD, which is known as the semi-supervised method, to train the AE model eﬀectively .
The
auxiliary output is depicted as Aux in Figure 1.
The reconstructed features and auxiliary classiﬁcation
can be written as
zi = f(Wi−1,izi−1 + bi−1,i)

where z1 = f(W0,1x + b0,1), and

For our stacked AE model, a rational value of α = 0.3 was selected experimentally, considering
the proportion of each loss.
In order to train the AE eﬀectively, both L2 normalization for weight
normalization and batch normalization were adopted [28,29].
After the training was completed,
we fetched the encoder of the AE as the feature extraction part for the joint optimization model in the
training procedures of the deep learning model.
2.3.
Establishing and Training the Deep Learning Model for ASD Detection
As the eGeMAPS data were set and the AE was trained through semi-supervised learning,
the machine learning models, such as SVMs, BLSTM, and joint optimized BLSTM were constructed.
Each model had its own input parameter dimensions and the same output targets as ASD and TD
classiﬁcation labels.
The eGeMAPS feature data were paired with the diagnostic results for the
supervised learning of the neural network models.
For the binary decision, ASD was labeled as
a positive data point, with a label of (0, 1), while TD was labeled as a negative data point (1, 0).
We composed four kinds of models with the paired data: SVMs with linear kernel, the vanilla BLSTM
with 88 eGeMAPS features, the vanilla BLSTM with 54 eGeMAPS features, and the jointly optimized
BLSTM layer with the AE.
The joint optimization model is depicted in Figure 2.
As the data set was
prepared as the input with ﬁve sequential frames, i.e., the grouped eGeMAPS features in Figure 2,
the SVMs received a single frame parameter of 440 dimension which was ﬂattened from the original
ﬁve input frames.
For the deep learning models, batch normalization, rectangular linear unit (ReLU)
activation, and dropout were applied for each layer, except for the output layer [30,31], and the
adaptive momentum (ADAM) optimizer  was used to train the network.
The training procedure
was controlled by early stopping for minimizing the validation error with 100 epoch patience, while
saving the best models for improvement of the validation loss by each epoch.
Because the amount
of speech data was relatively small for a deep learning model compared to the disparate ﬁeld of
audio engineering, we grouped the data into ﬁve segments, while the test utterances were separated
formerly, which were selected randomly for 10% of the total data, were evenly distributed across each
vocalization type, and underwent ﬁve-fold cross-validation for training; then, the best-performing
model was chosen.
Our model was trained with the TensorFlow framework .
For comparison,
an SVM model with linear kernel was trained with the same data split as the proposed deep learning
model, and as well as the vanilla BLSTM suggested in , which has single BLSTM with eight cells.

88 features of eGeMAPS, eGeMAPS-54 denotes 54 features selected by the Mann–Whitney U test,
and AE-encoded denotes the joint optimized model.
In the classiﬁcation stage, one utterance was
processed in the frame-wise method and the softmax output was converted to class indices 0 and 1, and
if the average of class indices of the frames was over 0.5, then the utterance was considered an ASD
child’s utterance.
The performances were scored with conventional measures, as well as unweighted
average recall (UAR) and weighted average recall (WAR), chosen in the INTERSPEECH 2009 Emotion
challenge, which considered imbalanced classes .
In the experiment, the SVM model showed very
low precision, which was extremely biased toward the TD class.
The BLSTM classiﬁer with 88 features
of eGeMAPS and the AE model showed considerable quality in terms of classifying ASD and TD
children, while the AE model showed only marginal improvement in correctly classifying children
with ASD compared to eGeMAPS-88.
The 54 selected features showed degraded quality compared to
eGeMAPS-88, obtaining more biased results toward children with TD.

Discussion
The vanilla BLSTM model presented in  conducted discrimination on well-classiﬁed subjects
with 10-month-old children and sorted 54 features from eGeMAPS that had a distinctive distribution
between ASD and TD selected by the Mann–Whitney U test using the three-fold cross-validation
method.
However, because the diﬀerence in the data distribution failed to achieve the same eGeMAPS
feature selection between the test and classiﬁcation results with the speciﬁed feature set presented
herein, the application of an identical model structure and the adoption of the same feature domain
will allow both approaches to be indirectly comparable.
These results can be interpreted by the data distributions, and we performed t-stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE) analysis  on the training data set, which can nonlinearly squeeze the data
dimension based on a machine learning algorithm.
Figure 3 shows each data distribution as a
two-dimensional scatter plot.
In the ﬁgure, the eGeMAPS features from eGeMAPS-88 and eGeMAPS-54
showed almost identical distribution, except for the amount of ASD outliers, which implies that the
ASD and TD features in the eGeMAPS features show similar distributions in this experiment.
As shown
in , eGeMAPS includes temporal features that are relevant to vocalizations and utterances; thus, these
features might cause confusion regarding the discrimination between ASD and TD.
The AE-encoded
features, however, showed a redistributed feature map with a more characteristic distribution compared
to the eGeMAPS features.
This is because the AE-encoded features were compressed into a bottleneck
feature, which was derived by weighting the matrix, paying attention to the signiﬁcant parameters

while reducing the inﬂuence from the ambiguous parameters.
While the joint optimization model
achieved only marginally improved results compared to eGeMAPS-88, the distribution of the feature
map would be more noticeable in improved feature extraction models, as well as more diﬀerentiable in
complex models, although BLSTM with eight cells was employed for a comparison with conventional
research in this experiment.
distribution compared to the eGeMAPS features.
This is because the AE-encoded features were 
compressed into a bottleneck feature, which was derived by weighting the matrix, paying attention 
to the significant parameters while reducing the influence from the ambiguous parameters.
While the 
joint optimization model achieved only marginally improved results compared to eGeMAPS-88, the 
distribution of the feature map would be more noticeable in improved feature extraction models, as 
well as more differentiable in complex models, although BLSTM with eight cells was employed for a 
comparison with conventional research in this experiment.
While the overall performance scores were comparably low for general classification problems 
on account of the subjectivity and complexity of problems, and the limitation in terms of the shortage 
of data, the results of the jointly optimized model imply the possibility of deep-learning-based feature 
extraction for the improvement of automated ASD/TD diagnosis under restricted circumstances.

Conclusions 
In this paper, we conducted experiments for discovering the possibility of auto-encoder-based 
feature extraction and a joint optimization method for the automated detection of atypicality in voices 
of children with ASD during early developmental stages.
Under the condition of an insufficient and 
dispersed data set, the classification results were relatively poor in comparison to the general 
classification tasks based on deep learning.
Although our investigation used a limited number of 
subjects and an unbalanced data set, the suggested auto-encoder-based feature extraction and joint 
optimization method revealed the possibility of feature dimension and a slight improvement in 
model-based diagnosis under such uncertain circumstances.

Conclusions
In this paper, we conducted experiments for discovering the possibility of auto-encoder-based
feature extraction and a joint optimization method for the automated detection of atypicality in voices
of children with ASD during early developmental stages.
Under the condition of an insuﬃcient
and dispersed data set, the classiﬁcation results were relatively poor in comparison to the general
classiﬁcation tasks based on deep learning.
Although our investigation used a limited number of
subjects and an unbalanced data set, the suggested auto-encoder-based feature extraction and joint
optimization method revealed the possibility of feature dimension and a slight improvement in
model-based diagnosis under such uncertain circumstances.
In future work, we will focus on increasing the reliability of the proposed method by addition
of a number of infants’ speech data, reﬁnement of the acoustic features, an auto-encoder for feature
extraction, and better, deeper, and up-to-date model structures.
This research can also be extended to
children with the age of 3 or 4 who can speak several sentences.
In this case, we will investigate the
linguistic features, as well as acoustic features, such as we have done in this paper.
In addition to ASD
detection, this research can be applied to the detection of infants with development delays.
