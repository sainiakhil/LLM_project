            "The present study proposes a multi-modular, machine learning-based approach to autism diagnosis in young children. This approach comprises three complementary modules: (1) a speech module for analyzing speech features, (2) a facial expression module for analyzing facial expression features, and (3) a behavior module for analyzing behavioral features. The use of multiple modalities in this approach allows for a more comprehensive assessment of autism symptoms and may lead to more accurate diagnoses compared to traditional methods that rely on a single modality. The proposed approach also has the potential to streamline the diagnostic process by reducing the time and labor expenses required for clinicians and administrators, and may help address the challenge of long wait times for at-risk children.

However, the feasibility of using eye contact as a measure in a mobile application is not well established.\" (Ekman et al., 2018)\n",

In the context of autism, reduced eye contact is often observed and can be a diagnostic indicator.\" (Ekman, 2003)\n",
            "In the study \"Positive Affect and Infant Sibling Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder\" published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, the authors found that \"Infants who later developed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) showed significantly less eye contact with their siblings during free play than did infants who did not develop ASD.\" (Fillit et al., 2015)\n",

            "The study by Fillit et al. (2015) investigated the use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to detect atypical patterns of facial expression in children with autism. The researchers found that children with autism showed significantly different facial expressions compared to typically developing children in response to emotional stimuli. Specifically, they found that children with autism had reduced intensity and duration of facial expressions, as well as abnormal facial configurations.\n",
            "Ekman (1997) and Ekman (2003) provide a comprehensive overview of facial expression and its relevance to emotion recognition. They describe the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) as a standardized method for analyzing facial movements and expressions. This system allows for the identification of specific facial actions and configurations, which can be useful in detecting atypical patterns of facial expression in individuals with autism.\n",
            "Therefore, the use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a valid method to detect atypical patterns of facial expression in children with autism.

The child with ASD frequently displays neutral expressions compared to a child without ASD, and the frequency of expressive movements is driven by non-ASD children.

            "The use of facial expressions in the diagnosis of autism has been explored in various studies. One such study published in the journal npj Digital Medicine in 2018 investigated the feasibility of using ResearchKit, an open-source software framework for mobile health research, to collect and analyze facial expressions in children with autism. The study found that machine learning algorithms could accurately distinguish between children with autism and typically developing children based on their facial expressions.\n",
            "Another study, published in the book \"Emotions Revealed\" by Paul Ekman, discusses the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which is a standardized system for analyzing facial expressions. The authors of a 2015 study published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders used FACS to analyze facial expressions in children with autism and their siblings. They found that children with autism showed fewer and less intense facial expressions compared to their typically developing siblings.\n",
            "Therefore, reduced and less intense facial expressions can be used as indicators for detecting Autism Disorder in children. However, it is important to note that facial expressions should not be the sole basis for diagnosis and should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools and assessments.\n",

            "The present study aimed to investigate the facial expressions of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development (TD) during a social interaction task. The results showed that children with ASD displayed fewer facial expressions overall, and their expressions were less variable and less socially appropriate than those of children with TD. Specifically, children with ASD showed fewer smiles, more frowns, and more neutral expressions than children with TD. These findings suggest that the analysis of facial expressions may be a useful tool in the early diagnosis of ASD.\n",

            "The use of machine learning algorithms in analyzing home videos for the early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has gained significant attention in recent years. In this study, we propose a method for developing a prospective, validated machine learning model for the detection of ASD from home videos. Our approach involves the following steps: (1) data collection and preprocessing, (2) feature extraction, (3) model selection and training, and (4) model validation and evaluation. We used a dataset of home videos of children with and without ASD, and applied various machine learning algorithms to identify features that distinguish between the two groups. Our results showed that a random forest classifier achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between the two groups, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.87. These findings suggest that machine learning algorithms can be effective in detecting ASD from home videos, and provide a promising avenue for early intervention and diagnosis.\n",

            "The Still-Face Experiment, developed by Tronick and his colleagues (Tronick, 1978), is a well-known procedure used to examine the broad phenotypic features of infants at risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Qiu et al., 2007). In this paradigm, the mother is instructed to maintain a still-face expression for a period of time while interacting with her infant. The infant's responses to the mother's still-face expression are then assessed. The Still-Face Experiment has been found to be a useful tool in identifying infants who are at high risk for developing ASD (Heimann, Laberg, & Nordøen, 2010). For example, infants with ASD may show decreased social interest and may not elicit imitative behavior in response to their mother's still-face expression (Heimann et al., 2010). Additionally, parents of infants with ASD may have a different parenting style, such as less use of social smiles, compared to parents of infants without ASD (Harker, Ibanez, Nguyen, Messing, & Stone, 2006).\n",
            "Therefore, the Still-Face Paradigm is a method used in early screening for high-risk autism spectrum disorder to examine the infant's response to a still-face expression of the mother and the mother's use of social smiles during interaction. Infants with autism spectrum disorder may show decreased social interest and less imitative behavior in response to the mother's still-face expression, and parents of infants with autism spectrum disorder may have a different parenting style, such as less use of social smiles.\n",
